Documentation
=============

This is the documentation for flarepy.
This is where I store all my code for the detection, evaluation and plotting for flare detections.
Primarily utilises GOES XRS X-ray timeseries data ATM.

.. note:: The layout of this directory is simply a suggestion.  To follow
          traditional practice, do *not* edit this page, but instead place
          all documentation for the affiliated package inside ``flarepy/``.
          The traditional practice was intended to allow the affiliated
          package to eventually be merged into the main astropy package.
          You can follow this practice or choose your own layout.
